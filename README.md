# GRASP-metahueristic-for-MULIOBJECTIVE-generalised-covering-multi-travelling-salesman-problem
Here in generalised covering multi travelling salesman problem (GCMTSP) we have assumed that we are given a set of vertices including depot, facility and customer vertices. Each customer i has a particular demand that will be satisfied when it is located within a certain coverage radius of at least one facility j visited by the tour. Basically each facility has a particular coverage radius R_i within that demand of all the available customers are covered. So, here we are not directly visiting the customers to satisfy there demand but we are visiting a subset of facilities in order to do so. Total number of salesman and the maximum distance that each salesman can travel is also known to us. One thing to be noticed is that a particular customer can be present within the coverage distance of more than one facility, then in that case demand of that customer can be fulfilled only by any one of those facilities. objectives are: 1) To maximize the amount of demand that can be covered 2) To minimize the distance travelled to meet that amount of demand.
